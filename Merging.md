# Merging
The idea of merging is to incorporate the changes in the branches from one branches to another.
  + we merge branches not commits
  + we merge to the current HEAD
 
## Steps to merge branch
 1. Switch to the branch you wan't to merge into.
 2. Use the command:
     > git merge "branchToMerge"
**The above step is used for fast forward merge.**
